      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hey there! I'm Temitope Akinyokun,
      and I'm diving into this programming adventure at AltSchool Africa. It
      feels like stepping into a new world where every line of code is a puzzle
      waiting for me to crack. So far, my experience here has shown me that
      there's more to learn, even in things I thought I had mastered. It's like
      I thought I knew the whole song, but there are these amazing remixes I've
      never heard before. This experience is challenging me in ways I didn't
      expect and pushing me to explore areas I hadn't considered before. Being
      here has also given me the opportunity to meet and interact with people
      embarking on this same journey. This has been a wonderful experience and a
      source of motivation to do better. The town hall and fun Friday meetings
      have also been eye opening to things to consider that will enhance both my
      social and networking skills. Despite having to balance AltSchool with
      academic work, the overall experience has been worth it.

      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, aside me being an AltSchooler,
      I am a 300 level Physiotherapy student of the first and best University in
      Nigeria, the University of Ibadan (permit my humility). Beyond coding, i
      have a couple of other things i enjoy doing like singing, taking walks,
      watching reality shows(they are my guilty pleasure.) and studying
      Anatomy... it really is fascinating how the body works.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what do i want to achieve here? i
      want to improve my skills as much as possible, both in programming and
      interacting with people. i want to build myself to become a world class
      Engineer, in the words of Mr Setemi.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, my journey at AltSchool is not merely about learning to
      code, it's about embracing the challenges, expressing creativity, and
      leaving a lasting mark in the digital signature that says "Hey, Temitope
      was here and did something awesome!". Hopefully, the force shall be with
      me.
